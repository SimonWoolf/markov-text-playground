======================

Markov generation!
http://markov.simonwoolf.net

Select what texts you want to use as inputs, and click 'analyze'. It'll look at the word just before the cursor position and give you the top 10 suggestions for the next word as button, click a word to insert it.

I haven't implemented uploading your own texts yet as I wanted to get the core working first, so
for the instance running at http://markov.simonwoolf.net
I've hardcoded two texts: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, and Asimov's Foundation (not included in this repo for obvious reasons).
